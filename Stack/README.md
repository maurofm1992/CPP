Stacks are a type of container adaptor, specifically designed to operate in a LIFO context (last-in first-out), where elements are inserted and extracted only from one end of the container (usually from the top). On this project you will be able to study the behavior of the stack.  

After practicing and studying the project you will be able to perform the following:

	(1) Manage a single linked list.
	(2) Implement a default constructor and a copy constructor in a Linked List.
	(3) Implement an insert function to add a character, in order, to a Linked List.
    (4) Implement a remove function to delete a character from a Linked List.
