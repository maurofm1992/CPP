Queues are a type of container adaptor, specifically designed to operate in a FIFO context (first-in first-out), where elements are inserted into one end of the container and extracted from the other. Usually you add items on the back and take them out from front.
You can thin of it as if it was a line in the supermarket, customers start to form a line going to the back of the line, and after the customer on front is finished leaves the queue through the front. 

After studying and evaluating the code you should be able to aquire this in your code.
