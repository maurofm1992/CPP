For this project you will see how the Single Linked list work in your code. Best way to understand it is debugging the program while you have a lot of breaks to see how it behaves.   

After practicing and looking at the code behavior, you should be able to perform the following:
           
	            (1) Manage a single linked list.
	            (2) Implement a default constructor and a copy constructor in a Linked List.
	            (3) Implement an insert function to add a character, in order, to a Linked List.
              	    (4) Implement a remove function to delete a character from a Linked List.
