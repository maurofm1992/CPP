For this project you will see how the Single Linked list work in your code. Each node of a singly linked list has data elements and a single link (pointer) that points to the next node of the list (or) NULL if it is the last node of the list. Addition/ Deletion of a node to the singly linked list involves the creation/ deletion of the node and adjusting the node pointers accordingly. Best way to understand it is debugging the program while you have a lot of breaks to see how it behaves. 

After practicing and looking at the code behavior, you should be able to perform the following:
           
	            (1) Manage a single linked list.
	            (2) Implement a default constructor and a copy constructor in a Linked List.
	            (3) Implement an insert function to add a character, in order, to a Linked List.
              	(4) Implement a remove function to delete a character from a Linked List.
